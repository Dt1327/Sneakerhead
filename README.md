Relationships
USERS & ORDERS
One-to-Many relationship: A User (USER_ID) can place multiple Orders (ORDER_ID), but each order is placed by only one user. This relationship is essential for tracking user activity and order history.
ORDERS & PAYMENTS
One-to-One relationship: Each Order (Order_ID) has a corresponding Payment (PAYMENT_ID) with details like payment method and status. This ensures accurate financial records and payment tracking.
ORDERS & SHIPPING INFORMATION
One-to-One Relationship: Each Order (Order_ID) has a single Shipping Information record (SHIPPING_ID), which tracks details like shipping method and delivery date. This is crucial for ensuring accurate and timely deliveries.
ORDERS & FEEDBACK
One-to-Many Relationship: A single Order (Order_ID) can have multiple Feedback entries (FEEDBACK_ID), but each feedback entry is linked to one specific order and user. This relationship helps in understanding customer satisfaction and areas for improvement.
ORDERS & PRODUCTS
One-to-Many Relationship: An Order (Order_ID) can contain multiple Products (PRODUCT_ID), but each product is assigned to a specific order. This is important for managing inventory and tracking product sales.
PRODUCTS & SUPPLIERS
Many-to-One Relationship: Multiple Products (PRODUCT_ID) can be supplied by a single Supplier (SUPPLIER_ID), but each product is associated with only one supplier. This relationship helps in managing supplier relationships and sourcing inventory.
PRODUCTS & PRODUCT CATEGORIES
Many-to-One Relationship: A Product (PRODUCT_ID) belongs to a single Product Category (CATEGORY_ID), but each category can have multiple products. This is crucial for organizing inventory and improving product discoverability.

Join Types in Database

INNER JOIN:
This join returns only the records that have matching values in both tables. For example, if we join the Users and Orders tables using an inner join, we will get a list of users who have placed at least one order. Users who have never placed an order will not be included in the result.
Query:
SELECT Orders.OrderID, Users.Name, Users.Email, Orders.OrderDate, Orders.TotalAmount FROM Orders
INNER JOIN Users ON Orders.UserID = Users.UserID;
Output:

Purpose:
Retrieves only matching records from both tables. If no match is found, the row is excluded. 
Use Cases
•	Getting customers who have placed orders.
•	Finding employees who belong to a department.
•	Fetching products that have categories assigned 
LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)
This join returns all records from the left table and only the matching records from the right table. If there are no matches, NULL values are displayed for columns from the right table. For example, if we join Users with Orders using a left outer join, we will get all users, including those who haven’t placed an order. Users without orders will have NULL values in the order-related columns.
Query:
SELECT Users.UserID, Users.Name, Orders.OrderID, Orders.TotalAmount FROM Users
LEFT JOIN Orders ON Users.UserID = Orders.UserID.

Output:

Purpose:
Return all records from the left table and matching records from the right table. If no match is found, NULL is returned.
Use Cases:
•	Finding users who haven’t placed orders.
•	Listing all products, even if they have no supplier.
•	Getting employees, even if they are not assigned to a department.

RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)
This join returns all records from the right table and only the matching records from the left table. If there are no matches, NULL values are displayed for columns from the left table. For example, if we join Orders with Users using the right outer joint, we will get all orders, including those that do not have associated users (e.g., orders placed by deleted accounts). Orders without users will have NULL values in the user-related columns.
Query:
SELECT Suppliers.SupplierID, Suppliers.Name, Products.Name AS ProductName FROM Suppliers
RIGHT JOIN Products ON Suppliers.SupplierID = Products.SupplierID.
Output:


 
Purpose:
Returns all records from the right table and matching records from the left table. If no match is found, NULL is returned.

Use Cases:
•	Listing all suppliers, even those who haven’t supplied any products.
•	Finding departments that don’t have any employees assigned.
•	Getting all orders, even if they don’t have a registered user.
 
CROSS JOIN
This join returns the Cartesian product of both tables, meaning every row from the first table is paired with every row from the second table. For example, if we perform a cross join between Users and Products, the result will show every user associated with every product, even if they have never purchased it. This can be useful for generating all possible combinations for recommendations or promotions.
Query:
SELECT Products.Name AS ProductName, Suppliers.Name AS SupplierName FROM Products 
CROSS JOIN Suppliers.
Output:
 

Purpose: Creates a Cartesian product (all possible combinations of rows).
Use Case:
•	Listing all possible combinations of products and suppliers.
•	Generating all possible matchups between players in a tournament.
•	Creating pricing models for all combinations of services and discounts.
